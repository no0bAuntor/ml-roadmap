# 🎯 Probability

## 📚 What is Probability?

- Probability tells us **how likely** an event is to happen.
- It ranges between **0** (impossible) and **1** (certain).

🧮 **Formula:**  
<!-- $$
\text{P(Event)} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$ -->
`P(Event) = (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Outcomes)`

🔹 **Example:**  
Tossing a fair coin 🎲:  
<!-- Probability of getting Heads = \( \frac{1}{2} \) -->
- Probability of Heads = `1/2`

## 🧩 Basic Concepts:

- **Experiment 🎯**:  
  An action that produces outcomes (e.g., tossing a coin).

- **Outcome 🎲**:  
  A possible result (e.g., "Heads" or "Tails").

- **Event 🎉**:  
  A collection of one or more outcomes (e.g., rolling an even number).

## 🔥 Key Ideas:

- **Sample Space (S)** ➡️ All possible outcomes.

- **Favorable Outcomes** ✅ ➡️ The outcomes we want.

- **Equally Likely Outcomes** 🎯 ➡️ Outcomes with the same chance.

- **Important Rules**:
  - Probability of a sure event = **1**.
  - Probability of an impossible event = **0**.
  - Sum of all probabilities = **1**.
