# Day 11: Multiclass Classification and Model Evaluation

On Day 11, we explored multiclass classification using scikit-learn with real-world datasets such as the digits and iris datasets. The main activities and concepts covered include:

- Loading and exploring the digits and iris datasets.
- Visualizing image data and understanding dataset structure.
- Splitting data into training and test sets for model validation.
- Training logistic regression models for multiclass classification problems.
- Making predictions and evaluating model performance.
- Using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualizing confusion matrices with seaborn heatmaps for better interpretation.
- Understanding the One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategy for handling multiclass problems.

This day provided hands-on experience with practical machine learning workflows and essential evaluation techniques for multiclass classification tasks.
